**Introduction**
--------------

This project implements a Q-learning agent to play Blackjack, a popular card game. The agent uses the Q-learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for playing the game.

**Installation**
--------------

No installation required! This project is a Python ipynb file that can be run directly.


**Results**
---------

Here's a plot showing the average rewards earned by the agent over time:
