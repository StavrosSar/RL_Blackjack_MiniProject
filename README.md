**Introduction**
--------------

This project implements a Q-learning agent to play Blackjack, a popular card game. The agent uses the Q-learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for playing the game.

**Installation**
--------------

No installation required! This project is a Python ipynb file that can be run directly.


**Results**
---------

Here's a plot showing the average rewards earned by the agent over time:

**Evaluation**
------------

The agent was evaluated by playing 1,000 episodes and recording the number of wins, losses, and draws:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Wins | 420 |
| Losses | 280 |
| Draws | 300 |
